## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
It varies. Sometimes I ask immediately, caught in the moment like the first article mentioned. Sometimes I wait a long time because I feel like I should know or be able to find the info myself. Typically though I ask in between because I usually try to answer the question myself first and am able to tell that Iâ€™m actually stuck.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I thought it was a good introduction into googling. I realized there were a couple more things i could write down for reference while i'm still learning but overall it felt comfortable.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
Conditional statements are the && || or ! symbols. A daily life example would be "do they like cream && sugar in their coffee?" I'm guessing most websites with a login have a conditional statement checking that the username and password fields both have something in them before running the credentials to the server.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
Check if condition1 && condition2 are both true, if they are, run this piece of code.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
the conditional statements would be useful. using && to ensure that both are true and using || to make sure that at least one is true.

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
the purpose of a function is to be able to pass many unique arguments into a piece of code rather than being stuck with one single defined variable.

1. What is a parameter? What is an argument? Why would you use one? Provide an example of a function that accepts an argument (declaration and call), and indicate what the parameter is and what the argument is.
A parameter is the defined variable within a function, an argument is the specific value that you want the parameter to take. name in the greet(name) is the parameter. 'Mary' in greet('Mary') is the argument.

function greet(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
greet('Mary');

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
No questions :) i'm looking forward to more practice!
