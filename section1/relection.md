## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  I feel like most of the article was fairly straight forward to be honest. I think the one that I related to was the Super Learners Teach Others What They Know. I feel like I try to do that often because 1. I like to help others and 2. because it solidifies the information in my mind. I would maybe add "taking good notes" or "having a good study system in place" as superlearner habits because those are key components to actually retaining information.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  We learned about numbers, strings, and booleans. A number includes integers (whole numbers) and floats (decimals), a string is typically a word but can also be a number but has to be wrapped in quotes, and a boolean is a true/false answer only (must be lower case).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  // to designate the entire line as a comment
  /* to designate a portion of the line as a comment */
  The purpose of comments are to provide context for a coder coming in behind you into code that they may night have understanding of.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  A variable is a like a category, where you can give it descriptions and values.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  Three variables that are probably commonly used are username (string), password (string), and status (boolean if only checking online vs offline).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  A concatenation is combining multiple variables into a sentence that's readable by the user.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
  Emails from banks, etc. have headers that say "Hello Alia!" at the top which would likely look like console.log('Hello' + username + '!');

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  I don't fully understand the use case for == vs ===. I guess I can't really think of an example that would involve comparing a number to a string or something similar. So I don't understand why you would ever need to use ===.
