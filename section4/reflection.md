## Section 4 Reflection

1. TODO: add Questions about Section4 Focus

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?  
 An object is able to store data by using key-value pairs while an array is only able to store items in an indexed list.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

    * List of all of the students in class  
      array - list of strings  
    * List of states and their capitals  
      object - involves key-value pairs
    * List of things to pack for vacation  
      array - list of strings
    * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow  
      array - list of strings
    * List of student names and their cohort  
      object - key-value pairs
    * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake  
      object - key-value pairs
    * All my favorite restaurants  
      array - list of strings

1. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?  
 Each post in a slack channel may be an object which includes the author, timestamp, content, comments, reactions.

1. What would the class, or blueprint, for the Object above, look like? Write the code to create the class, then create at least 3 object instances using that class.

    ```
    var slackPost = {
      author: 'Alia',
      timeStamp: '8:45 PM September 12, 2020'
      content: "Example information!"
      comments: []
      reactions: []
    }
    ```

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?  
 No questions!! Exciting to learn more information. This was the first time i felt challenged and it was great!
