## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
 Two points that resonated with me are: understanding that mistakes are essential to learning and that someone with a growth mindset tends to seek out challenges.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
 I think I'm already pretty good at most of the points listed in the article. I try to set goals for myself that are measurable and achievable and I know that working hard and practicing will lead to me becoming a better coder (and person). I'm not afraid to seek out help most of the time and I tend to like a challenge. I don't feel that I particularly _don't_ demonstrate any of the growth mindset items.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
 Discord has a member list which includes all of the people who have access to the server. I believe this is an array since it's a list that can have an item added/removed.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
 An array method is a variable which is defined by a list of items. These items all have an assigned index and can be removed, added, reordered, etc.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
 A loop is a function that allows us to rerun a piece of code a set number of times. You would use a loop in conjunction with an array when you would like some code to be run on every item in the array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
 We'll start with 0 gummi bears and we want to get to 10 gummi bears. When we look at the pile of gummi bears and see that it has less than 10 gummi bears, we'll add one. So now we have 1 gummi bear. Is 1 less than 10? Yes, so we add one. Now we have 2 gummi bears. We repeat this process until our pile of gummi bears has 10.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
 I can't think of any questions. I have some coding experience so arrays and loops are still familiar to me.
